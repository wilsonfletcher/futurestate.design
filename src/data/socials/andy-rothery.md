So, Sunday evening, a glass of Red and an advance copy of the book from Mark Wilson. I read a lot and occasionally pick up a few real nuggets of insight. Tonight I’m overdosed in nuggets!

What a great read and brought back so many memories of working with a great leadership team and the challenging maestro that is Mark! aka wilsonfletcher.com

“Chase a trend and end up in the same place as everyone else”….

“Is that where you want your future business to be ?”

Off to refill the glass….
