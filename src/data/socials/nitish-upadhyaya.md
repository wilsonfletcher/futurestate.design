Having submitted my dissertation, it’s time to attack my ever-growing stockpile of new books! I couldn’t resist the temptation to sneak this short but sweet number from Mark Wilson to the top of the pile. It presents some incredibly practical lessons which dovetail neatly with lessons from user-centred design and behavioural science. In short, how do we genuinely scope out the future direction for a business? We’re not talking about tweaking a business model based on data here, but fundamental changes to target the market of tomorrow. There’s a lot in the 100-odd pages but here are a few choice observations that stood out:

➡ “If you think about the future with what you know today, you’ll inevitable end up in a version of the same place” – availability bias affects us all, and we really do have to transform our mind-set to open ourselves up to new perspectives and opportunities. We seem to be obsessed with digitising our current processes without questioning whether they are needed in the first place or blindly carrying over inefficiencies into our sparkly new tech-enabled way of working.

➡ “Future success will not come from being logical or following industry trends. Logic and trend-chasing take you to the same place as everyone else” – groupthink, whether within an organisation or more generally in an industry is a real limiter. It shouldn’t really be about what our competitors are doing, but about what our customers will think, and how they will behave, in the future.

➡ To that end, “the ultimate goal of Futurestate design is to enable new behaviours” – the trick is in picking out those behaviours. It’s the research that would be considered irrelevant commercially but generates information that is highly relevant behaviourally that helps us articulate the next big service offering. Customers are both setting benchmarks for your offering based on their best experiences in other fields and building patterns of behaviour through those interactions. If we can tap into these behaviours, we have the chance of building a relevant future service offering.

Cheers Rae Morgan for the advanced copy and indulging me in chats about sci-fi and fantasy fiction! Here's to continuing to do things differently!
