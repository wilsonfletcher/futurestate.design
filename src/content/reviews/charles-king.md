description: Traditional advice on insurance transformation puts far too much weight on fixing today’s issues, and as a consequence, anchors thinking in the past and risks dragging technical and design debt into an organisation’s future. The result is often incremental change, at best. Wilson Fletcher, in stark contrast, advocate an original, bold and refreshing future-first approach. Their tools and techniques help prime an organisation’s mindset to work collectively in order to envisage a truly aspirational yet achievable future state. The result for Pacific Life Re was bold, engaging, inspirational and tangible vision of what our organisation is aiming to become.
